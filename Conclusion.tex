\section {Conclusion}
\smallskip

Moving forward, network security is expected to remain a top priority. With the use of WSNs, cloud implants, reigning in IoT, and increasing automated attacks, the role of the network security administrator will likely change based on the types of threats in the future, as well as advances in the technologies and processes organization and government use to combat those threats. On the other end, SDN is beginning to prove itself as a viable solution to helping handle security concerns in networks. Much of the research surrounding new security mechanisms attempts to leverage new technologies, such as SDN, to try and bridge the gap of current security mechanisms and the requirements that they fail to satisfy. As more devices begin to connect to the internet, these concerns become more relative. With new solutions being developed and tested, the need for security will always fall behind in terms of innovation due to the rapid evolution of IoT devices. Overall, security will continue to rely on existing tools, techniques and practices to defend networks while new methods and mechanisms are developed to meet current and future security requirements.
