\section {Introduction}

Security concerns will always remain a relevant topic of conversation. As technology innovations continues to excel at an astonishing rate, their design may satisfy only the general security requirements but that may not be enough. As devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, continue to be developed and deployed into networks, security concerns will continue to rise. Since there is such a variety of devices that can connect, utilizing a single security mechanism is simply not enough. In this paper, we attempt to survey research done on current and proposed mechanism for securing networks. While a single security mechanism is not ideal for every situation, much can be learned from the research that has been done to construct new security mechanisms and methods that can leverage new technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) to create more secure and dynamic environments that can accommodate the diversity of devices and satisfy security requirements. Although these new technologies leverage many beneficial tools and features, they also pose new challenges as they are inherently susceptible to their own vulnerabilities.
